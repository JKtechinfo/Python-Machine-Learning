# Python-Machine-Learning

Machine Learning is a very up-to-date topic very useful in different fields! More companies are adopting this new technology to perform work efficiently!

In the folders, you will find the complete Python code for different Machine Learning basic applications, such as Linear Regression. Remember to download both Python and text files and save them in the same folder, otherwise you will get an error. 

IMPORTANT!: Please keep in mind that some libraries are not included in the Python package when downloading it. If this is the case, you can simply solve this problem by typing in the command prompt (cmd) pip install (#name of the missing library). Examples:

pip install pandas

pip install numpy
